# GitHubCodeReviewFileMinimizer

A Chrome extension that automatically minimizes code file content for files that don't generally need a review.  For example in .NET solutiosn generally you don't need to review changes to `.sln`, `.csproj`, `.vbproj`, or `package.config` files.  If the solution builds the content of these must be good enough :)
